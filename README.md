# activelearning

There are 2 files under this project QBC and PS, each represent a strategy of active learning

Training files:

1-100: This is the file containing data for initial training

combat: This is the file generated by QBC algorithm, we tagged them

proba: This is the file generated by PS algorithm, we tagged them

random: This is a random selection of 100 rows from the same 1000 rows where the other 2 algorithm did their pick from


Testing file:

101-200: testing file, selected outside of data used and exposed



results:

These are the results generated by using 3 types of data through the 2 learning algorithms (MLP and SVM) described in paper


To run: just simply "run all"
